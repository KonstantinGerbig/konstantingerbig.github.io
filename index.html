<p>
I am a theoretical Astrophysicist, currently a PhD candidate in the Astronomy Department at Yale University. 
My primary research interests are planet formation theory and protoplanetary disks.
I am also interested in orbital dynamics in binary systems, exoplanetary demographics and architectures, computational astrophysics, and general astrophysical magneto-hydrodynamics involving instabiliies and turbulence, as well as related applications in meteorology and atmospheric physics.

<p>
I am currently working with <a href="https://astronomy.yale.edu/people/gregory-laughlin">Greg Laughlin</a> who is my thesis adviser. 
Additionaly, I have ongoing collaborations with <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/malenarice/">Malena Rice</a> (Yale), Min-Kai Lin (ASIAA), and Rixin Li (Berkeley).
Prior to Yale, I went to Ruprecht Karl's University Heidelberg, Germany, where I graduated with a Bachelor's in 2017 and a Master's in 2019. 
I have worked at the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy with <a href="https://www.mpia.de/person/32777/1415887">Hubert Klahr</a> from 2016-2020, and spent a year in 2018/19 at the Department for Astrophysics and Astronomy at UC Santa Cruz working with <a href="https://murrayclay.astro.ucsc.edu/">Ruth Murray-Clay</a>.
