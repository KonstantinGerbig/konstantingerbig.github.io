Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets. Since they are composed of gas and dusty grain orbiting a central star, we analyze the physics of protoplanetary using hydrodynamics. Specifically, hydrodynamics can describe the flow of the protoplanetary disks using a set of governing equations, which characterize the conservation of mass, momentum, energy, magnetic fields or other relevant quantities. 

My research so far has been concerned with non-magnetized, isothermal protoplanetary disks, and local processes occuring therein. By "local" in the context of protoplanetary disk, we typically refer to the so-called shearing box reference frame being a good approximation. There, instead of the full disk, we are only interested in a small patch of the disk, where a cartesian coordinate frame can be applied. Due to Kepler's laws, material orbiting the central star on annuli closer in, will have a faster orbital velocity compared to material orbiting further out. This effect imposes a shear motion on the fluid within the local patch, giving rise to the name 'shearing box'. The shear is of crucial importance in all disk hydrodynamics including my research, as it adds another ficticious force to the momentum equation, in addition to coriolis and centrifugal force. The shear is also the background motion you can see in all movies I have shared on this website or on my YouTube channel.

While most of my research projects include some amount of discussion of protoplanetary disk hydrodynamics, on this page, I want to highlight two projects specifically, which have contributed the most to the field. They are (1) Hurricane-like Vortices in Protoplanetary Disks and (2) Diffusive Instabilities.
